# Sorting Algorithms & Big O
<h3>This is the sorting algorithms repository where it is stored the implementations of some sorting algorithms</h3>

****
## About this project
- In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), a **sorting algorithm** is an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") that puts elements of a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(computing) "List (computing)") in a certain [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order "Computer science").
- **Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.**

## Implementing some Sorting Algorithms
<h2>Bubble Sort</h2>
This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.

<h2>Insertion Sort</h2>
A simple sorting technique that scans the sorted list, starting at the beginning, for the correct insertion point for each of the items from the unsorted list.

<h2>Selection Sort</h2>
This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.

<h2>Quick Sort</h2>
This works by iterating over the input array, swapping elements that are strictly less than a pre-selected pivot element. They appear earlier in the array, but on a sliding target index.
